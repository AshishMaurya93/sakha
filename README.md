# Sakha: Buddy to Your Study

A minimalist, responsive web application inspired by the design aesthetic of Lemonade's Giveback 2019 page. **Sakha** is built to present a clear, visual narrative around the educational challenges students face — and the simple, welcoming solution provided by Sakha Learning Centers.
